# Myocardial-Ischemia-Detection-by-Analysing-ECG-Signal
Processing ECG Signal, QRS and ST Segment Detection, BPM Calculation, ST Slope Measurement and Myocardial Ischemia Detection.

I have done this project on my 4th year of B.Tech and submitted as Final Project. In this project I collected various ecg signals from online opensources and used them to study the behaviour of the signal in the presence of abnormal heart rate and myocardial ischemia.  

<b>SYSTEM ANALYSIS & DESIGN:</b>

The QRS complex (or R peak) is detected from the ECG signal. Based on that, BPM (Beats Per Minute) is calculated. Then ST segmentation is computed and slope of the ST segment is measured. A threshold is set and ischemic episode is detected according to that threshold.

<b>•	Database:</b> ECG signals are used from the Physiobank database (Goldberger et al., 2000). The European ST-T database in Physiobank contains ECG signals with ST segment and T wave changes (Taddei, et al., 1992). The database contains ECG signals from ischemic patients where normal ECG sections and sudden ischemic episodes are annotated.
